        <h2>Introduction to Software Engineering</h2>
        <p><b>Software</b> is a program or set of programs containing instructions that provide desired functionality.</p>
        <p><b>Engineering</b> is the process of <b>designing</b> and <b>building</b> something that serves a particular purpose and finds a cost-effective solution to problems, it is the <b>application of scientific and practical knowledge</b> to invent, design, build, maintain, and improve frameworks, processes, etc.</p>
        <p><b>Software engineering</b> is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software. Software engineering includes a variety of techniques, tools, and methodologies, including requirements analysis, design, testing, and maintenance.</p>
        <p>The IEEE has developed the following definition for software engineering:</p>
        <p class="def">(1)The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintainence of software; that is, the applicaiton of engineering to software. (2) The study of approaches as in (1).
        </p>
        <p>Software Engineering is required due to the following reasons:</br>
           >>  To manage Large software</br>
           >>  For more Scalability</br>
           >>  Cost Management</br>
           >>  To manage the dynamic nature of software</br>
           >>  For better quality Management</br>
