       <p><b>Sequential Model:</b> It is also called a <b>linear sequential model</b>, <b>classic life cycle</b> or <b>waterfall model</b>. It suggests a systematic, sequential approach to Software Development that begins at a systematic level and progresses through communication, planning, modeling, construction, and deployment. The steps are as follows:</p>

       <p><b>Some Circumstances where the use of the Waterfall model is most suited are:</b></p>
         <ul class="list">
             <li>When the requirements are constant and not changed regularly.</li>
<li>A project is short</li>
<li>The situation is calm</li>
<li>Where the tools and technology used is consistent and is not changing</li>
<li>When resources are well prepared and are available to use.</li>
</ul>
       <p><b>Advantages of Sequential model:</b></p>
       <ul class="list">
        <li>This model is simple to implement also the number of resources that are required for it is minimal.</li>
        <li>The requirements are simple and explicitly declared; they remain unchanged during the entire project development.</li>
        <li>The start and end points for each phase is fixed, which makes it easy to cover progress.</li>
        <li>The release date for the complete product, as well as its final cost, can be determined before development.</li>
        <li>It gives easy to control and clarity for the customer due to a strict reporting system</li>
       </ul>

       <p><b>Disadvantages of Sequential model:</b></p>
       <ul class="list">
        <li>The risk factor is higher, so this model is not suitable for more significant and complex projects.</li>
        <li>This model cannot accept the changes in requirements during development.</li>
        <li>The start and end points for each phase is fixed, which makes it easy to cover progress.</li>
        <li>It becomes tough to go back to the phase. For example, if the application has now shifted to the coding phase, and there is a change in requirement, It becomes tough to go back and change it.</li>
