        <h2>Software Engineering: A layered Technonoly</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Software engineering is a fully layered technology.</li>
            <li>To develop a software, we need to go from one layer to another.</li>
            <li>All these layers are related to each other and each layer demands the fulfillment of the previous layer</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="se-layers.jpg">
        <p><b>The layered Technology consists of:</b></p>
        <ol class="list">
            <li><b>Quality focus:</b> The characteristics of good quality software are:
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Correctness of the functions required to be performed by the software.</li>
                <li>Maintainability of the software</li>
                <li>Integrity i.e. providing security so that the unauthorized user cannot access information or data.</li>
                <li>Usability i.e. the efforts required to use or operate the software.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><b>Process:</b>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>It is the base layer or foundation layer for the software engineering.</li>
                    <li>The software process is the key to keep all levels together.</li>
                    <li>It defines a framework that includes different activities and tasks.</li>
                    <li>In short, it covers all  activities, actions and tasks required to be carried out for software development.</li>
                </ul></li>

            <li><b>Methods:</b>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>The method provides the answers of all 'how-to' that are asked during the process.</li>
                        <li>It provides the technical way to implement the software.</li>
                        <li>It includes collection of tasks starting from communication, requirement analysis, analysis and design modelling, program construction, testing and support</li>
                    </ul></li>
            <li><b>Tools:</b>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>The software engineering tool is an automated support for the software development.</li>
                            <li>The tools are integrated i.e the information created by one tool can be used by the other tool.</li>
                            <li>For example: The Microsoft publisher can be used as a web designing tool.</li>
                        </ul></li>
