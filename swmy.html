        <h2>Software Myths</h2>
        <p>Software myths are the erroneous beliefs about software and the process that is used to build it. Myths create major problems for management and practitioners alike.</p>
        <p>The types of software myths are as follows:</p>
        <img src="Myth1.png" height="200" width="400">
        <p><b>Management Myths:</b> Managers with software responsibility are often under pressure to maintain budgets, keep schedules and improve quality. Some of the managemt myths are:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><b>Myth:</b> <i>We have all the standards and procedures available for software development</i><p><u> Fact:</u> Software experts do not know all the requirements for the software development. And all existing processes are incomplete as new software development is based on new and different problem</p></li>
            <li><b>Myth:</b> <i>The addition of the latest hardware programs will improve the software development</i><p><u> Fact:</u> The role of the latest hardware is not very high on standard software development; instead (CASE) Engineering tools help the computer, they are more important than hardware to produce quality and productivity. Hence, the hardware resources are misused</p></li>    
            <li><b>Myth:</b> <i>With the addition of more people and program planners to Software development can help meet project deadlines (If lagging behind)</i><p><u> Fact:</u> If software is late, adding more people will merely make the problem worse. This is because the people already working on the project now need to spend time educating the newcomers, and are thus taken away from their work. The newcomers are also far less productive than the existing software engineers, and so the work put into training them to work on the software does not immediately meet with an appropriate reduction in work.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Customer Myths:</b> The customer can be the direct users of the software, the technical team, marketing / sales department, or other company. Customer has myths leading to false expectations (customer) & that’s why you create dissatisfaction with the developer. Some of the customer myths are:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><b>Myth:</b> <i>A general statement of intent is enough to start writing plans (software development) and details of objectives can be done over time</i><p><u> Fact:</u> Official and detailed description of the database function, ethical performance, communication, structural issues and the verification process are important. Unambiguous requirements (usually derived iteratively) are developed only through effective and continuous communication between customer and developer</p></li>
            <li><b>Myth:</b> <i>Software requirements continually change, but change can be easily accommodated because software is flexible</i><p><u> Fact:</u> It is true that software requirements change, but the impact of change varies with the time at which it is introduced. When requirements changes are requested early (before design or code has been started), the cost impact is relatively small. However, as time passes, the cost impact grows rapidly—resources have been committed, a design framework has been established, and change can cause upheaval that requires additional resources and major design modification.</p></li>    
        </ul>
        <p><b>Practitioner’s Myths:</b> Some practitioner’s myths are:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><b>Myth:</b> <i>They believe that their work has been completed with the writing of the plan.</i><p><u> Fact:</u> It is true that every 60-80% effort goes into the maintenance phase (as of the latter software release). Efforts are required, where the product is available first delivered to customers</p></li>    
            <li><b>Myht:</b> <i>There is no other way to achieve system quality, until it is “running”.</i><p><u> Fact:</u> method. These updates are quality filters and more accessible than test</p></li>
            <li><b>Myth:</b> <i>Engineering software will enable us to build powerful and unnecessary document & always delay us.</i><p><u> Fact:</u>Software engineering is not about creating documents. It is about creating a quality product. Better quality leads to reduced rework. And reduced rework results in faster delivery times.</p></li>
