        <h2>The Process and The Product</h2>
        <p>A<b>process</b> is a collection of activities, actions and tasks that arre performed when a work product is to be created</p>
        <p>A software process is the set of activities and associated outcome that produce a software product. Software engineers mostly carry out these activities. These are four key process activities, which are common to all software processes. These activities are:
           <ul class="list">
            <li><b>Software specifications</b>: The functionality of the software and constraints on its operation must be defined.</li>
            <li><b>Software development</b>: The software to meet the requirement must be produced.</li>
            <li><b>Software validation</b>: The software must be validated to ensure that it does what the customer wants.</li>
            <li><b>Software evolution</b>: The software must evolve to meet changing client needs.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>In the classic book,<i>How to Solve It</i>, George Polya outlined the essence of problem solving, and consequently, the essence of software engineering practice:
    <ol class="list">
        <li><i>Understand the problem</i>(communication and analysis)</li>
        <li><i>Plan a solution</i>(modelling and software design)</li>
        <li><i>Carry out the plan</i>(code generation)</li>
        <li><i>Examine the result</i>(testing and quality assurance)</li>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Software process or software development process is also called SDLC.
       Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality software.
       It is not rigid but it is adaptable approach which means details of the process will be different for different type of software.
